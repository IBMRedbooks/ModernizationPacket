# ModernizationPacket
This repository contains diverse content a business can use to help deal with the cultural obstacles to modernization. It is intended to provide a business with materials that can be used to explain to executives as well as the rank and file of the company the different values that modernization brings about, with the hope that it will allay fears that accompany the kind of change modernization brings about.

This is not a strictly technical repository. It is intended to provide the materials needed to teach why and how rather than what. Code and specific user jopurneys focused on modernization can be found in a number of different locations including:
